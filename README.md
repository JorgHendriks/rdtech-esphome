# Riden RD6006 controller via ESPHome

This device allows you to control a Riden RD6006 Power Supply via Home Assistant. It uses ESPHome to abstract modbus commands and expose them to Home Assistant and makes it super easy to interface with your device over WiFi.

It is a replacement for the (frankly terrible) software running on the Riden WiFi module and intended as a replacement for their mobile apps and Windows software.

The functionality is currently *very* limited, but can easily be extended by borrowing ideas from https://github.com/Baldanos/rd6006, which was a huge inspiration for this project.
